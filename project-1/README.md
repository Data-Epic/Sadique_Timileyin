# Using gspread to write to a Google sheet
## Data Source:
I used the data gotten from https://food.com
## Project Description:
In this project I scraped data from a website called food.com the data targeted was their top comfort food recipes.
Whereby I saved the data fetched from the website using Gspread a Google sheet API that allows me to write to a Google 
sheet seamlessly.
In the code written in the main.py file there are two ways to upload the data to the Google sheet in which I specified 
using comments.
